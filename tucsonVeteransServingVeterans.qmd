## About Tucson Veterans Serving Veterans

Tucson Veterans Serving Veterans will continue to work closely with our state and city officials, Department of Veteran Administration, and local organizations regarding COVID-19 to ensure that every veteran remains in their home, has access to financial assistance and resources, and essential needs during this time.
